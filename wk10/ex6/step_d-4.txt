Issue Observed on Browser:--------------------------------The browser displays the contents of the server's directory structure. The directory listing includes several system folders such as:- backups- cache- crash- lib- local- log- mail- opt- run- snap- spool- tmp- wwwThis confirms that the application is vulnerable to **directory traversal attacks**, allowing access to system directories.
