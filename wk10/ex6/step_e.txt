### Issues Mitigated1. **Prevent Viewing Files & Folders Before `html` Directory**   - Used `basename()` to strip any directory traversal attempts (`../`).   - Ensures that only valid folder names are processed.2. **Prevent Viewing Non-Existing Folders**   - Used `file_exists()` and `is_dir()` to check if the requested folder exists.   - If the folder does not exist, the script stops execution with an error.### BONUS Fix- Blocked filenames in input by checking for a dot (`.`) in the directory name.- Prevents users from accessing individual files instead of directories.- Helps stop direct access to hidden files (e.g., `.htaccess`).### Recommended Additional Fixes- Disable directory listing in the server using `.htaccess`:
