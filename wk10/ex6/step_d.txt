Issue Observed on Browser:--------------------------------The browser displays warning messages indicating that the PHP script is trying to scan a directory that does not exist. Specifically, the error message states:1. "Warning: scandir(hello): Failed to open directory: No such file or directory in /var/www/html/directory_traversal_part1.php on line 7"2. "Warning: scandir(): (errno 2): No such file or directory in /var/www/html/directory_traversal_part1.php on line 7"This suggests that the script is attempting to read a directory named "hello" that does not exist.Sensitive Information Exposed:--------------------------------1. **File Path Disclosure**: The warning message reveals the absolute file path (`/var/www/html/directory_traversal_part1.php`), which can be useful for attackers to understand the server's structure.2. **Function Exposure**: The use of `scandir()` is shown in the error message, which confirms that the script is attempting to list files in a directory.3. **Error Details**: The exact error (`errno 2`) suggests the directory is missing, which could help an attacker test for directory traversal vulnerabilities.
