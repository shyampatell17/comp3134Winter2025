Key Differences:• strip_tags() removes HTML and PHP tags but does not modify special characters inside the tags. It’s useful when you want to display plain text and ignore tags.• htmlspecialchars() escapes special characters and ensures that any HTML-like input is rendered safely, preventing malicious code from being executed on the page.Which to Use:• If you need to completely remove HTML and PHP tags from a string and don’t need to handle special characters, use strip_tags().• If you’re dealing with user input that might contain potentially dangerous HTML or JavaScript, and you want to safely display it without executing any code, htmlspecialchars() is the better option.
